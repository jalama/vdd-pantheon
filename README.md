# Vagrant Drupal Development for Pantheon

This project is exactly the same as the original [VDD](https://www.drupal.org/project/vdd) and all the changes in the stable branch will be pulled into this repository. 

This project only does the following: 

1. VirtualBox shared directories are slow, so they are disabled here; instead, you can mount a directory of your choice via `sshfs`;
2. [Terminus CLI](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli) is installed by default;
3. **[TODO]** A deployment script to deploy Pantheon site locally is provided.
